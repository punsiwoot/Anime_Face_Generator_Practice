# Anime_Face_Generator_Practice
    this repository is a code about trying to imprement a deeplearning method to generate 
    a anime face by using GAN 

## DC-GAN 
    using Generator that got trained in process(anime_generator.ipynb) to create  
    image from random latent space with resolution 256x256 size. as you can
    see the result is not quite smooth so we need another method to make a 
    model perform better
### result image

### loss image
